# This requirements file contains all AI related requirements
# it is splitted that the testing pipelines without dedictated servers
# have not to install GB of unused dependencies
# They can't execute real AI Pipleine test as they don't have GPUs and the models
diffusers       # for stable diffusion general
transformers    # for image generation
accelerate      #for low cpu
torch           # for gpu support and ai operations
xformers        # memory optimization
notebook        # for analytics in jupyter notebooks
insightface     # Face recognition for tokens
opencv-python   # Face recognition for tokens
onnxruntime     # Face recognition CPU based (required for onnx models), use only if you not have a gpu
onnxruntime-gpu # Face recognition GPU based (required for onnx models)
